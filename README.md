# python-api-challenge Module 6
Overview
Welcome to the repository containing a detailed analysis to understand, What is the weather like as we approach the equator using Python APIs.

Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?".

Objective
The goal of this project is use APIs to pull data and answer questions using data and maps.

Tasks
The analysis encompasses several key tasks:

Data preparation and cleaning.
This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.


Instructions
To replicate this analysis:

Ensure Python and jupyter installed.
Clone this repository.
Run `WeatherPy.ipynbâ€™ first and then VactionPy.jpynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Make sure to create API keys to # OpenWeatherMap API Key and # Geoapify API Key


Observations and Insights
Observations are in jupyter Notebook

Contribution
Contributions, suggestions, and critiques are welcome.
